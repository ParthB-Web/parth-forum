        <p><em>There are wounds that don't close. Ever.<br>
        Not the kind that aches for bandages –<br>
        but the kind that becomes part of your nervous system.</em></p>

        <p><em>You don't walk away from them.<br>
        You build yourself around them.<br>
        They twist your shape, your voice, your instinct.<br>
        And every feeling you have after them<br>
        has a different weight.<br>
        A different kind of reality.<br>
        A different cost.</em></p>

        <p><em>I couldn't play the game the way they wanted.<br>
        Not because I didn't try.<br>
        But because something in me refused to lie.</em></p>

        <p class="short-verse"><em>So I stepped out.<br>
        Not in retreat – but in rebellion.</em></p>

        <p><em>I didn't want the trophy.<br>
        I wanted to see the code.<br>
        I thought if I could dissect the thing–<br>
        life, love, desire, failure and the list goes on,<br>
        I'd find some kind of power.<br>
        Maybe even salvation.</em></p>

        <p class="short-verse"><em>But all I found was how rigged it all is.<br>
        How absurd.<br>
        How impossible.</em></p>

        <div class="poem-break">⋆ ⋅ ☾ ⋅ ⋆</div>

        <p><em>But knowing doesn't save you.<br>
        It just strips away illusion.<br>
        You see too clearly.<br>
        You feel too much.</em></p>

        <p><em>And that's a strange kind of suffering –<br>
        being awake in a world that wants to stay asleep.</em></p>

        <p class="short-verse"><em>And yet, even in that,<br>
        I still crave love.</em></p>

        <p><em>Not the kind they sell in movies.<br>
        But the kind that knows what ruin smells like.<br>
        The kind that doesn't flinch when it sees the blood.<br>
        The kind that says,<br>
        "I see the wreckage. I'll still sit with you."</em></p>

        <p><em>And sometimes I feel like –<br>
        even that – love…<br>
        is nothing but morphine.</em></p>

        <p><em>For the pain of the deepest wound I carry –<br>
        the meaningless void – that I am –<br>
        and my awareness of it.<br>
        And my heart's yearning for meaning,<br>
        to go through the hell that life is.<br>
        And for identity –<br>
        because without it,<br>
        the suffering of this hell is all in vain.<br>
        Isn't it?</em></p>

        <div class="poem-break">⋆ ⋅ ☾ ⋅ ⋆</div>

        <p><em>Maybe it's selfish.<br>
        But it's not fake.<br>
        It doesn't erase the wound –<br>
        but when someone sees it,<br>
        really sees it –<br>
        it doesn't ache in the same way.</em></p>

        <p class="short-verse"><em>It becomes witnessed.<br>
        It becomes bearable.<br>
        Sometimes, that's all you need.</em></p>

        <p><em>People think I'm idealistic.<br>
        They don't understand.<br>
        My idealism isn't naive.<br>
        It's earned.</em></p>

        <p><em>It's born from staring into the abyss,<br>
        over and over,<br>
        and still hoping there's something sacred<br>
        hiding in the pitch-black mess.</em></p>

        <p><em>Although when I point my flashlight towards it,<br>
        it's all empty.<br>
        Nothing.<br>
        Always.</em></p>

        <p class="short-verse"><em>But this stubbornness doesn't go away.<br>
        I need to find something.<br>
        I do not want to turn back empty handed,<br>
        and live – empty.</em></p>

        <div class="poem-break">⋆ ⋅ ☾ ⋅ ⋆</div>

        <p><em>To me, love is the purest thing there is –<br>
        and the second most precious thing after truth.</em></p>

        <p><em>And by "purity," I don't mean perfection.<br>
        I mean the kind of clarity that comes<br>
        when two fucked-up, raw, half-healed people<br>
        see each other without performance.</em></p>

        <p class="short-verse"><em>When two souls, warped by experience,<br>
        still try to collide gently.<br>
        That's sacred.<br>
        That's real purity.</em></p>

        <p><em>I test people.<br>
        Not to hurt them.<br>
        But because I've been hurt.<br>
        So I show them my softest parts with quiet dread,<br>
        expecting them to leave.</em></p>

        <p><em>And if they stay, I show more.<br>
        Worse.<br>
        Deeper.<br>
        Until either they break,<br>
        or I finally believe.</em></p>

        <p><em>And if they walk away,<br>
        I comfort myself with what I already knew –<br>
        that no one stays through all of it.</em></p>

        <p><em>And when I fail – because I do – I spiral.<br>
        I investigate.<br>
        I overanalyze.<br>
        Not to feel bad,<br>
        but to never let it happen again.</em></p>

        <p class="short-verse"><em>I take the hit now<br>
        so I won't bleed later.<br>
        That's how I survive.<br>
        That's how I protect what matters.</em></p>

        <div class="poem-break">⋆ ⋅ ☾ ⋅ ⋆</div>

        <p><em>People don't get it when I say<br>
        my greatest joy comes from my deepest pain.</em></p>

        <p class="short-verse"><em>But it's simple.</em></p>

        <p><em>If you know how truly fucked everything is –<br>
        if you carry that knowledge not as an idea<br>
        but as a body state –<br>
        then any moment of light,<br>
        any touch,<br>
        any laugh,<br>
        feels like a miracle.</em></p>

        <p class="short-verse"><em>It feels unjustified.<br>
        Holy.<br>
        Real.</em></p>

        <p><em>And yes, I crave pain sometimes.<br>
        Not because I enjoy it –<br>
        but because it feels true.<br>
        It doesn't lie when it says I matter.<br>
        It doesn't try to flatter.</em></p>

        <p><em>Pain clarifies everything that is me.<br>
        The depth of my misery,<br>
        and my awareness of it,<br>
        shows me my depth –<br>
        then I no longer feel dead.</em></p>

        <p><em>Like how I find everything else – to be dead –<br>
        including me, usually.</em></p>

        <p><em>But then there's joy –<br>
        it shows me that I'm not stuck there.<br>
        In my mind.<br>
        It shows me the fleeting nature of life and time.<br>
        Still I cannot help but smile.</em></p>

        <p class="short-verse"><em>—Pain and Joy: The dichotomy of life.</em></p>

        <div class="poem-break">⋆ ⋅ ☾ ⋅ ⋆</div>

        <p><em>I've always believed that my brokenness<br>
        had to be justified.<br>
        That I needed to be wise,<br>
        or beautiful,<br>
        or strong because I was hurt.</em></p>

        <p><em>But maybe the real strength is this:<br>
        to not defend the wound.<br>
        To just bleed.<br>
        And to let someone hold your hand while you do.</em></p>

        <p class="short-verse"><em>If that ever happens –<br>
        really happens –<br>
        then maybe the wound wasn't a curse.<br>
        Maybe it was a doorway.</em></p>
