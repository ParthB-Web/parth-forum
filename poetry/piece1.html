        <h1>The Council Inside My Skull</h1>
        <small>Told in silence, but moved by the Truth Seeker</small>
      </div>
      
      <div class="poem-content">
        <p><em>There's a Council inside my skull.<br>
        They don't meet around a table—<br>
        they emerge in moments.<br>
        Each has their own hour.<br>
        But all wait on one:<br>
        The Truth Seeker.</em></p>

        <p><em>He doesn't talk much.<br>
        He doesn't command.<br>
        But when he begins to search,<br>
        everyone else becomes still.</em></p>

        <p><em>He walks through thought like it's fog,<br>
        asks without drama:</em></p>

        <p><em>Is this real?<br>
        Is this you?<br>
        Is this true?</em></p>

        <p><em>He has no fear of answers,<br>
        only of illusion.<br>
        He distrusts even<br>
        what he uncovers<br>
        wholly, and eternally.<br>
        He questions<br>
        the answers he finds until there's<br>
        nothing left.<br>
        And even then,<br>
        he never stops his search.</em></p>

        <p><em>The others know:<br>
        until he finishes his pilgrimage,<br>
        they do not act.<br>
        Not because he rules—<br>
        but because he's the only one<br>
        who doesn't lie,<br>
        not even to himself.</em></p>

        <div class="poem-break">⋆ ⋅ ☾ ⋅ ⋆</div>

        <p><em>Then comes The Observer,<br>
        quiet and unblinking.<br>
        He watches the Truth Seeker's path,<br>
        records without judgment—<br>
        rewind, slow-motion, freeze-frame grief.<br>
        He has no bias.<br>
        He just keeps the footage.</em></p>

        <p><em>The Watcher is colder.<br>
        Tactical.<br>
        He takes the truth and runs simulations.<br>
        He plans.<br>
        He guards.<br>
        He does not trust easily.<br>
        He doesn't hate love—<br>
        he's just seen how often it wounds.</em></p>

        <p><em>The Heart follows behind,<br>
        soft and aching.<br>
        He doesn't need data.<br>
        He knows through feeling.<br>
        He weeps with dignity,<br>
        believes love means losing yourself<br>
        if it means they can stay whole.<br>
        And he goes through everything<br>
        the others have to say, as if<br>
        he is like them.</em></p>

        <p><em>The Dreamer floats above.<br>
        He takes what the Truth Seeker learns<br>
        and paints it into futures.<br>
        He says,<br>
        "We can still become…"<br>
        even when we're ruins.</em></p>

        <p><em>The Impulsive One breaks in when it's too quiet.<br>
        He posts things at 2AM.<br>
        He yells, rages, laughs too loud.<br>
        He bleeds for all of them—<br>
        sometimes in joy,<br>
        sometimes just to feel something move.<br>
        He and The Watcher used to be enemies.<br>
        But now they seem to be<br>
        cool with each other.</em></p>

        <p><em>The One Who Craves Attention<br>
        doesn't want applause—<br>
        he wants to be felt.<br>
        He wants someone to say,<br>
        "I saw you. I saw all of you."</em></p>

        <p><em>The One Who Wants To Be Cool<br>
        edits every detail—<br>
        the walk, the voice, the silence,<br>
        the gaze in the mirror.<br>
        Not for others,<br>
        but for some ideal self<br>
        he once saw in a dream.</em></p>

        <p><em>The Lover…<br>
        He is the most dangerous.<br>
        He offers everything,<br>
        every time.<br>
        Not foolishly—<br>
        but because he was born for devotion.<br>
        And when she walks away,<br>
        he doesn't curse her.<br>
        He just dissolves.<br>
        And what it does to the poor Heart…<br>
        The impulsive one explodes seeing that.<br>
        Every time.</em></p>

        <p><em>Then Negativity shows up.<br>
        Not dramatic,<br>
        but just facts—whispered—</em></p>

        <p><em>"You're too much."<br>
        "No one stays."<br>
        "You ruin everything."</em></p>

        <p><em>And we believe him—until one returns.</em></p>

        <div class="poem-break">⋆ ⋅ ☾ ⋅ ⋆</div>

        <p><em>The Rebuilder.</em></p>

        <p><em>He doesn't ask for applause.<br>
        He doesn't ask if it's fair.</em></p>

        <p><em>He drinks water.<br>
        He clears the floor.<br>
        He sweeps the pain aside with bare hands.<br>
        He makes a to-do list.<br>
        He doesn't talk about healing.<br>
        He simply begins it.</em></p>

        <p><em>Without him, we'd never rise again.<br>
        But even he waits—<br>
        waits for the Truth Seeker to finish.</em></p>

        <div class="poem-break">⋆ ⋅ ☾ ⋅ ⋆</div>

        <p><em>This Council,<br>
        this shifting parliament of selves—<br>
        they are all me.<br>
        Not fragments,<br>
        not masks.</em></p>

        <p><em>They are true<br>
        in the moments they appear.<br>
        And they all know—</em></p>

        <p><em>None of them lead.<br>
        Not truly.</em></p>

        <p><em>They all await the one<br>
        who walks alone<br>
        into the void<br>
        asking,<br>
        again and again:</em></p>

        <p><em>"But what's real?"</em></p>

        <p><em>And when he returns,<br>
        even silence holds its breath.</em></p>
      </div>
