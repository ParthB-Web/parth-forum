        <p><em>Wandering around, wondering—<br>
        If no one can act outside what shaped them,<br>
        then who do we blame?<br>
        What is cruelty<br>
        when intention dissolves into origin?<br>
        A fist raised isn't born in the wrist—<br>
        it travels,<br>
        from a father's silence,<br>
        a society's hunger,<br>
        a thousand quiet rejections<br>
        threaded into one explosive need<br>
        to be felt.</em></p>

        <p><em>Even the cruelest man<br>
        was once just trying<br>
        to feel safe.</em></p>

        <p><em>So what do we do<br>
        with punishment,<br>
        with forgiveness,<br>
        when both ask us to pretend<br>
        we had choices?</em></p>

        <p><em>They say she left<br>
        because I wasn't enough.<br>
        But did she choose that?<br>
        Did she know her reasons?<br>
        Did I know mine<br>
        when I withdrew,<br>
        when I stilled,<br>
        when I became smaller<br>
        than the man she wanted?</em></p>

        <p><em>It was never a choice.<br>
        It was a momentum.<br>
        A wave neither of us saw until it broke.</em></p>

        <div class="poem-break">⋆ ⋅ ☾ ⋅ ⋆</div>

        <p><em>Wandering around, wondering—<br>
        How do you cry in front of your parents<br>
        and still feel like a fracture<br>
        in their dream of a son?<br>
        They say the words—<br>
        love, pride—<br>
        but you hear the space between them,<br>
        the part where you didn't become<br>
        what the world told them a child should be.</em></p>

        <p><em>Even that disappointment<br>
        wasn't theirs to choose.<br>
        They too were shaped.<br>
        They too inherited the script.<br>
        So who am I to be angry?</em></p>

        <p><em>And yet—<br>
        anger comes.</em></p>

        <p><em>So what can anyone be,<br>
        but a consequence?</em></p>

        <div class="poem-break">⋆ ⋅ ☾ ⋅ ⋆</div>

        <p><em>Wandering around, wondering—<br>
        How do you trust someone<br>
        when you see the scaffolding behind their voice?<br>
        When you watch their affection flicker—<br>
        not out of betrayal,<br>
        but out of their own unseen storms?</em></p>

        <p><em>It's not that they're lying.<br>
        It's worse.<br>
        They mean it.<br>
        But they'd mean something else<br>
        if they were built differently.</em></p>

        <p><em>And you know that.<br>
        You see it.<br>
        So you sit there,<br>
        trying to receive the love,<br>
        while your mind dissects the source.</em></p>

        <p><em>What is love,<br>
        if it's just coping that fits for a while?</em></p>

        <p><em>What is loyalty,<br>
        if it ends the moment their fear shifts shape?</em></p>

        <p><em>Even the ones who ghost you,<br>
        who confuse you,<br>
        who don't call back—<br>
        you see it:<br>
        it was never personal.<br>
        It was their wiring,<br>
        their conditioning,<br>
        their unfinished stories speaking louder than they could.</em></p>

        <p><em>And you?<br>
        Even your silence,<br>
        your withdrawal,<br>
        your craving for distance—<br>
        it's not a choice either.</em></p>

        <p><em>It's the cost of seeing too much.</em></p>

        <div class="poem-break">⋆ ⋅ ☾ ⋅ ⋆</div>

        <p><em>Wandering around, wondering—<br>
        Why does knowing strip away belonging?<br>
        Why does empathy isolate?</em></p>

        <p><em>They want good and evil.<br>
        You see variables.<br>
        They want heroes.<br>
        You see inputs and reactions.</em></p>

        <p><em>So now,<br>
        you move through life<br>
        like a ghost with skin—<br>
        present, but not quite here.<br>
        Because once you see<br>
        what moves people,<br>
        you stop believing in what they say.<br>
        Not because they're false—<br>
        but because they're real,<br>
        and real is made of parts<br>
        they've never seen.</em></p>

        <p><em>And that's the wound.<br>
        Not betrayal.<br>
        Not abandonment.<br>
        Just the unbearable clarity<br>
        that no one's home<br>
        behind their own eyes.</em></p>

        <p><em>And maybe<br>
        neither are you.</em></p>
